# Move Book

Learning notes from https://move-book.com/ and other resources.

> This book is dedicated to Move, a smart contract language that captures the essence of safe programming with digital assets. Move is designed around the following values:
> * Secure by default
> * Expressive by nature
> * Intuitive for all

> The core technical elements of Move are:
> * Safe, familiar, and flexible abstractions for digital assets via programmable objects.
> * A rich ability system (inspired by linear types) that gives programmers extreme control of how values are created, destroyed, stored, copied, and transferred.
> * A module system with strong encapsulation features to enable code reuse while maintaining this control.
> * Dynamic fields for creating hierarchical relationships between objects.
> * Programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) to enable atomic client-side composition of Move-powered APIs.
